			The <meta> element below is important to help change the size of our browser window to reflect the size of the device. It works as follows:

				name="viewport" - this clarifies that we are declaring something about the viewport (aka browser window)
				'width=device-width' - this specifies that the width of the viewport should be equal to the width of our device (important for mobile devices)
				'initial-scale=1' - this ensures that our website renders not zoomed-in or zoomed-out, as we have designed it to be responsive.

		<h1>My Less Hideous Page</h1>

		<p>
			A robot is a <em>dangerous</em>, often humanoid, autonomous being that will take over soon. We must be vigilant. We must be wary. We must prepare to stop the robots from taking over. Transformers are here and are real. Robots such as Honda's <abbr title="Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility">ASIMO</abbr> is proof of that. They walk, and soon enough they will also be able to talk and drive us around. That is dangerous.
