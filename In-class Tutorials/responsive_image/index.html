		<h1>Responsive Images Demo</h1>

		<p>As part of making your websites more 'responsive friendly', there are a couple of proposals for responsive images that were developed by the <a href="https://responsiveimages.org/" target="_blank">Responsive Images Community Group</a>. There is the &lt;picture&gt; element which allows for 'art direction' of an image by using multiple sources, as well as the "srcset" and "sizes" attributes which allow us to offer browsers a variety of image resolutions to choose from.</p>

		<p>It is a good idea to take a look at <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=srcset" target="_blank">how supported "srcset"</a> and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=picture" target="_blank">the &lt;picture&gt; element</a> are before use.</p>

				<!--
					We should always start with the img element regardless to support as many different devices and browsers as possible.
